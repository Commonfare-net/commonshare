    <h1>Commonshare - An Introduction</h1>

    <h4>What does it mean?</h4>
        <p>Each commoner has their own 'Commonshare' value, which represents their contribution to the Commonfare platform. This will be visualised on their profile as shown in the image on the right:
        </p>

    <h4>How does Commonshare increase?</h4>

    <p>Commonfare recognises a number of ways in which a commoner can contribute to the growth and sustainability of the platform. There are four main types of interactions:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Social interactions</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Story sharing</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Transactions</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Information sharing</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following sections briefly describe the interactions commoners can have to increase their commonshare. </p>
    
    <h4>Social interactions</h4>

    <div style="float:left;width:45%">Although commonfare.net is far more than just a social network, social interactions are still important for the growth and sustainability of the platform. Commoners can interact to share advice, support, or information with one another.
        <p>Commonshare can be increased by:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Having a <strong>conversation </strong>with another commoner</li>
            <li>Becoming a <strong>member </strong>of a group</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p><img alt="" src="images/convo.PNG" style="width: 600px; height: 289px; border-width: 2px; border-style: solid;" /></p>

    <p>Story sharing</p>

    <div style="float:left;width:45%">
        <p>The 'Commoners Voices' section of commonfare.net allows Commoners to create stories of their experiences, and comment on those of others. Story interactions allow the experiences of others to be disseminated to a wider audience, and allow story authors to receive feedback.<br />
        Commonshare is increased by:</p>

        <ul>
            <li style="float: left; width: 45%;"><strong>Creating </strong>a new story</li>
            <li style="float: left; width: 45%;"><strong>Commenting </strong>on the story of another commoner</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <img alt="" src="images/stories.PNG" style="width: 600px; height: 332px;" />
    
    <h4>Transactions</h4>

    <div style="float:left;width:45%">
        <p>The Commonplace section of commonfare.net is where Commoners can exchange help, resources, skills and knowledge. This can be done for free, for direct trades, or you can ask to exchange for Common Coin, the digital token used on commonfare.net. </p>

        <p>Commonshare is increased by:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Making a successful <strong>transaction</strong> with another commoner </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <img alt="" src="images/transactions.PNG" style="width: 600px; height: 264px;" />
    
    <h4>Information sharing</h4>

    <div style="float:left;width:45%">commonfare.net has pages where Commoners can provide details on public benefits in their local area, such as businesses and organisations that aim to connect and inspire others towards collaboration and commonality. 
        <p> Commoners can contribute by: </p>

        <ul>
            <li style="float: left; width: 45%;"><strong>Sharing </strong>information on help available</li>
            <li style="float: left; width: 45%;"><strong>Requesting</strong> information on help available</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <br />
    <img alt="" src="images/gp.PNG" style="width: 600px; height: 289px;" />
    
    <h3>Why is Commonshare important?</h3>

    <div style="width:45%;float:left">
        <p>The commonshare will show how much each commoner contributes to the platform, and what contributions they make. Increasing one's commonshare could have benefits such as an increased basic income. More importantly, it builds trust by showing that a commoner is an active, contributing member of the community.</p>

        <h4>How is it different from other 'reputation systems'?</h4>

        <p> A Commoner's reputation is not based on their ability to provide a service or product. There is no such system that labels a Commoner as<br />
            'good' or 'bad'. Instead, reputation is built up through interactions that support the common good. Supporting others and offering services <br />
            are valued, and so is requesting this support. Those who reach out and ask for help also contribute to a collaborative society.</p>
